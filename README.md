# Pulsar
A platform for publishing posts and comments. Users can create posts, browse the feed on the home page, and open individual posts with a paginated list of comments. Admin can view and block users. Frontend built with Angular, backend with Strapi 5.

#### Demo: https://pulsar-app.netlify.app/
#### Strapi Cloud Demo project scaled down to save resources. Strapi needs time to start it back up - so requests to demo may take more time (wait a moment and try refresh the page).
